# Splunk Troubleshooting & Lessons

The final platform is stable. This file records only engineering problems that changed how the team built or validated the platform. 

The format is simple:

```text
problem -> evidence -> root cause -> correction -> verification -> lesson
```

## 1. Initial one-off container was not durable enough

**Problem**

The first working Splunk container used `splunk/splunk:latest`, `RestartPolicy=no` and Docker-created anonymous volumes. Splunk itself ran, but the deployment was not reproducible across host/container lifecycle events.

**Correction**

The final platform moved to:

```text
splunk/splunk:10.4.2
Docker Compose
restart: unless-stopped
named external volumes
private host bindings for 8000 / 9997
repository-safe config files
```

**Lesson**

A successful `docker run` is not the same as a durable SIEM platform. Version pinning, persistence, restart behavior and recovery need to exist before real telemetry is trusted.

## 2. Host restart exposed the missing restart policy

After an EC2 stop/start cycle, Docker returned but the original container stayed stopped because its restart policy was `no`. Splunk Web therefore had no listener on TCP `8000`.

The final `unless-stopped` policy was validated with both a normal Compose restart and a Docker daemon restart.

**Lesson**

Recovery behavior should be tested, not assumed from a healthy first boot.

## 3. Splunk CLI checks require the correct container user

Early CLI checks produced permission warnings around Splunk runtime/PID files when run under the wrong container identity.

The reliable health check is:

```bash
docker exec -u splunk dns-soc-splunk \
  /opt/splunk/bin/splunk status
```

**Lesson**

A permission warning from an administrative shell command is not automatically evidence that Splunk data is corrupt. Re-run the check using the account expected by the containerized application before escalating the issue.

## 4. Provisioning restart loop / internal HEC API `401`

**Problem**

During Compose provisioning, Splunk itself started but the container repeatedly exited when the image's provisioning workflow reached an internal HEC API check and received HTTP `401 Unauthorized`.

![Provisioning restart loop evidence](screenshots/troubleshooting/hec-401-provisioning-loop.png)

**Correction**

The team stopped the restart loop, preserved both named volumes and backups, then reconciled the protected bootstrap/admin credential with Splunk's stored admin state. The repository keeps only the safe environment example.

HEC remains **not host-published**. It is now used only through the internal Docker path by the completed shared AI integration.

**Lesson**

Identify the exact failing task before deleting data or rebuilding. Splunk had already reached its management service; the failure was authenticated provisioning rather than disk, RAM or Docker networking.

## 5. Receiver exposure was tightened before final acceptance

TCP `9997` is a forwarder receiver, not a public service. A broad temporary rule was replaced with:

```text
SG-WEB -> SG-SPLUNK TCP 9997
```

Splunk Web TCP `8000` remains limited to approved team source addresses.

**Lesson**

Application health, Docker port publishing and AWS security-group controls all need to agree.

## 6. Index retention was verified explicitly

The project indexes were created before log onboarding, but retention initially reflected a longer default. All five original common project indexes were corrected to the intended 30-day policy:

```text
frozenTimePeriodInSecs = 2592000
```

**Lesson**

Index creation is not finished when the names appear. Size and retention should be checked before production-like data arrives.

## 7. Ubuntu 26.04 / KV Store compatibility led to a clean host rebuild

**Problem**

The first Splunk EC2 host was built on Ubuntu 26.04. The platform could run, but the later AWS/Kinesis work exposed an unhealthy legacy KV Store/MongoDB state. Continuing on that host would have made the AWS Add-on checkpoint unreliable.

The original host screenshot is retained only as historical evidence:

![Legacy Ubuntu 26 host preflight](screenshots/troubleshooting/legacy-55-ubuntu26-host-preflight.png)

**Root cause / decision**

The project needed a supported, predictable host foundation for Splunk `10.4.2` and KV Store. Rather than trying to force the old database path to work, Sonia then rebuilt `dns-soc-splunk01` cleanly on **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS**.

The rebuild kept the architecture stable:

```text
same instance role
same private IP: 10.50.20.10
same SG model
same 100 GiB storage target
same Splunk 10.4.2 image
same named-volume / receiver / index design
```

**Verification**

The rebuilt platform passed Gate A again and KV Store reported:

```text
status        : ready
serverVersion : 8.0.26
```

AWS Add-on `8.2.1` was then installed and the EC2 IAM role was successfully autodiscovered.

**Lesson**

When a core state service is unhealthy on an unsupported host combination, a clean supported rebuild can be safer and easier to explain than layering fixes onto an uncertain base.

## 8. Route 53 data initially landed outside the project index

**Problem**

The Route 53 Kinesis input successfully collected data, but the first events were not placed in the intended project index.

**Correction**

The input destination was corrected to:

```text
index=dns_soc_aws
```

Fresh Route 53 events were generated after the change and validated there with the real `aws:kinesis` sourcetype.

**Lesson**

Collection success and data placement are separate checks. An input is not complete until index, source, sourcetype and time behavior are all correct.

## 9. Direct S3 -> SQS inputs failed SNS signature validation

This was the main Gate C ingestion issue for both VPC Flow Logs and CloudTrail.

### What the pipeline showed

AWS delivery was healthy. The queue metrics showed messages being sent and received, while successful deletion remained at zero.

![VPC SQS processing stall](screenshots/troubleshooting/vpc-sqs-processing-stall.png)

*The VPC queue metrics narrow the fault to Splunk-side message processing rather than AWS delivery.*

![CloudTrail SQS processing stall](screenshots/troubleshooting/cloudtrail-sqs-processing-stall.png)

*CloudTrail showed the same receive-without-delete pattern.*

```text
source service -> S3        working
S3 -> SQS                   working
Splunk polling SQS          working
message deletion            not happening
```

The Splunk internal log showed:

```text
Invalid signature version None
Unable to verify signature
```

### VPC Flow evidence

### CloudTrail evidence

![CloudTrail SQS signature validation error](screenshots/troubleshooting/cloudtrail-sqs-signature-validation-error.png)

**Root cause**

The project uses direct:

```text
S3 -> SQS -> Splunk
```

The input option **Signature Validate All Events** expected SNS signature fields, but direct S3 notifications do not provide an SNS signature wrapper.

**Correction**

The option was disabled for the direct S3 -> SQS inputs. No SNS layer was added. Resolver Query Logging was created with the setting disabled from the start.

**Verification**

After the change:

- SQS messages were processed successfully;
- VPC Flow Logs appeared as `aws:cloudwatchlogs:vpcflow`;
- CloudTrail appeared as `aws:cloudtrail`;
- final Gate C data-quality searches passed.

**Lesson**

When SQS messages are received but never deleted, check the collector's internal processing log before changing AWS delivery architecture.

## 10. Shared AI HEC path required HTTPS

**Problem**

The scheduled synthetic alert reached the AI bridge and the OpenAI request succeeded, but the bridge failed when returning the result to Splunk:

```text
AI bridge -> Splunk HEC
ConnectionResetError: [Errno 104] Connection reset by peer
```

**Evidence / isolation**

Scheduler logs proved the saved search ran successfully. Bridge logs proved the webhook and OpenAI processing also succeeded. That narrowed the failure to the final HEC hop.

A direct protocol test showed the active HEC listener accepted:

```text
https://dns-soc-splunk:8088/services/collector/event
```

and not the HTTP URL initially configured.

**Correction**

The bridge environment was updated to use internal HTTPS HEC. Because the current Splunk internal certificate is not trusted inside the bridge container, the lab currently uses:

```text
SPLUNK_HEC_VERIFY_TLS=false
```

The traffic is still encrypted on the host-local Docker network; certificate verification remains a future hardening item.

**Verification**

The next scheduled synthetic alert completed the full path and produced structured events in:

```text
index=dns_soc_ai
sourcetype=dns_soc:ai:triage
```

**Lesson**

When a multi-stage integration fails, validate each hop independently. Scheduler success, webhook receipt, OpenAI success and HEC success are separate checks.

## 11. Scenario 01 Kinesis checkpoint interruption — KV Store / host-kernel recovery

**Problem**

During Scenario 01 Detection Engineering, authoritative DNS queries were succeeding but fresh `aws:kinesis` Route 53 events stopped appearing in Splunk. Historical events remained searchable, so the symptom could easily have been mistaken for a bad detection or alert window.

**Evidence / isolation**

The known-good Scenario 01 detection was left unchanged while the ingestion path was traced. Splunk internal logs showed the AWS input failing to obtain checkpoint details and returning KV Store initialization errors.

The host was running the newer AWS kernel:

```text
7.0.0-1011-aws
```

while the previously installed compatible kernel remained available:

```text
6.17.0-1017-aws
```

**Safe correction**

The recovery was kept reversible. A one-time GRUB boot into `6.17.0-1017-aws` was used to test the compatibility hypothesis.

Sonia deliberately did **not**:

- delete KV Store data;
- rebuild the Splunk container;
- destroy Docker volumes;
- remove the newer kernel;
- rewrite Kinesis or Scenario 01 detection configuration.

**Verification**

After the compatible-kernel boot:

- the Splunk container recovered normally;
- KV Store became healthy;
- AWS Kinesis checkpoint processing resumed;
- a fresh authoritative DNS probe appeared again in `index=dns_soc_aws sourcetype="aws:kinesis"`;
- the existing Scenario 01 detection began seeing current events without a rule change.

**Lesson**

When fresh telemetry disappears, prove the ingestion layer before changing a validated detection. Protect known-good configuration and prefer a reversible diagnostic change before destructive recovery.

## Final outcome

The corrections above did not change the core project design. They improved the implementation until it matched the intended operating model:

```text
supported host
    -> reproducible Compose service
    -> healthy KV Store
    -> named persistence
    -> controlled network exposure
    -> stable restart behavior
    -> validated indexes / retention
    -> trusted Web telemetry
    -> trusted AWS telemetry
```

> Only concise, useful engineering evidence is kept in the repository. Historical screenshots are clearly labelled when they no longer represent the current deployed state.

## Scenario 02 — dedicated Unbound log handoff

### Symptom

Real Unbound query/reply events were visible in system logging, but the first rsyslog rule did not create `/var/log/dns-soc/unbound.log`.

### Root cause

The output file ownership did not let the `syslog` writer create/write the file while still allowing the Splunk forwarder to read it.

### Final fix

The file was pre-created with:

```text
owner = syslog
group = splunkfwd
mode  = 0640
```

and the final rsyslog `omfile` action uses the same ownership. This gives a narrow Unbound-only input instead of monitoring all of `/var/log/syslog`.

### Data-quality lesson

Do not declare a source onboarded after only seeing raw events. Scenario 02 validated index, host, source, sourcetype, time, core DNS fields and reply metrics before the resolver dataset was considered ready.
