This folder records **what has actually been built in AWS**. Architecture files explain the design; these documents capture deployed configuration, validation and reusable infrastructure evidence.

| Route 53 VPC Resolver Query Logging — both VPCs | ✅ Complete |
| AWS-to-Splunk delivery resources / IAM | ✅ Complete |
| `SOC-MONITORING-NAT` + monitoring-subnet private egress | ✅ Complete |
| Scenario 02 `SG-DNS`, `SG-VICTIM`, `SG-SINKHOLE` | ✅ Complete |
| Scenario 02 resolver/victim/sinkhole EC2s | ✅ Complete |
| Unbound forwarding resolver + persistent victim DNS path | ✅ Complete |
| Private Nginx sinkhole | ✅ Complete |
| Unbound RPZ safe-match / controlled redirect / reset | ✅ Complete |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The AWS build folder preserves what was actually built in the defender account, including the original `ATTACK-LAB-VPC` and `dns-attack01`. Those artifacts are historical engineering evidence. The official Scenario 01 information-separated exercise now uses a Kali attacker in a **separate AWS account**, so attacker-account infrastructure is intentionally not mirrored into this defender build record.

## 🏗️ Current AWS Environment

```text
PUBLIC / SHARED
Route 53 public DNS → dns-soc-web01
AWS telemetry → CloudWatch/Kinesis or S3/SQS → Splunk

PRIVATE SCENARIO 02
SOC-MONITORING-SUBNET 10.50.30.0/24
    dns-soc-resolver01 10.50.30.10
    dns-soc-victim01   10.50.30.20
    dns-soc-sinkhole01 10.50.30.30
         │
         ├─ private NAT egress through SOC-MONITORING-NAT
         └─ local SOC paths to Splunk 10.50.20.10:9997
```

The Scenario 02 service path is documented in [`08-scenario-02-defender-dns.md`](08-scenario-02-defender-dns.md). Splunk-side resolver/sinkhole onboarding is in [`../03-splunk-build/07-scenario-02-dns-onboarding.md`](../03-splunk-build/07-scenario-02-dns-onboarding.md).

## 🧪 Scenario-Specific AWS State

| Scenario | AWS-side state |
|---|---|
| **01 — DNS Recon** | Shared foundation complete; no extra infrastructure required |
| **02 — DGA** | **Resolver/victim/sinkhole + NAT/SG/RPZ infrastructure complete** |
| **03 — Fast Flux** | ✅ Implemented: three controlled HTTP nodes, `SG-FLUX-ENDPOINTS`, 60s Route 53 A record, controlled UPSERT rotation, victim/VPC Flow validation — see [`09-scenario-03-fast-flux.md`](09-scenario-03-fast-flux.md) |
| **04 — DNS Tunneling** | Reuse Scenario 02 platform; add an authoritative endpoint only if final controlled design needs it |

Scenario 02 infrastructure completion does **not** mean the DGA scenario itself is complete. The dedicated Scenario 02 repository now also records Machine Learning Engineering, Detection Engineering, Dashboard Studio, scheduled alerting and Scenario 02 AI evidence integration as complete. The fresh official adversary/SOC/IR/response-verification exercise still belongs there.

Primary screenshots are shown next to the configuration they prove. Repetitive troubleshooting captures are not published; the technical record keeps root cause and the final fix instead.
