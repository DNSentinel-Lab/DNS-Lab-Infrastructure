# Base Network Architecture

The current official Scenario 01 trust model separates the adversary from the defender **by AWS account**, not only by VPC. The defender platform remains in `SOC-LAB-VPC`; the official Kali attacker is in a separate AWS account and reaches only public services.

The original in-account `ATTACK-LAB-VPC` is retained as historical engineering infrastructure and is not the official Scenario 01 information-separated source.

```

## Trust boundaries

- The official external attacker account has no VPC peering, Transit Gateway or private cross-account route to the defender.
- The historical in-account attack VPC also has no private route to the SOC VPC.
- The public Web target is intentionally reachable through the Internet on 80/443.
- Splunk Web is restricted to approved team source addresses; administration uses SSM.
- The Scenario 02 resolver and sinkhole are private-only.
- `SG-DNS` accepts DNS only from the victim security group.
- `SG-SINKHOLE` accepts HTTP only from the victim security group.
- Universal Forwarders use the VPC-local path to `10.50.20.10:9997`.

## Routing

### SOC public subnets

`SOC-TARGET-SUBNET` and `SOC-SIEM-SUBNET` use the SOC public route table and Internet Gateway where the current design requires public reachability.

### SOC monitoring subnet

`SOC-MONITORING-SUBNET` is explicitly associated with `SOC-PRIVATE-RT`:

```text
10.50.0.0/16 -> local
0.0.0.0/0    -> SOC-MONITORING-NAT
```

`SOC-MONITORING-NAT` is in the public `SOC-TARGET-SUBNET` in `us-east-1c`.

The resolver's normal DNS path does not depend on the NAT:

```text
10.50.30.20 -> 10.50.30.10:53 -> 10.50.0.2 -> DNS authority
```

## Public DNS authority

Hostinger remains the registrar. Route 53 hosts the parent zone and delegates `soclab.abdul4rehman215.tech` to the child hosted zone. The public child zone remains separate from the private Scenario 02 RPZ/sinkhole control.

## Scenario 02 defender path

```text
Victim 10.50.30.20
    |
    | UDP/TCP 53
    v
Resolver 10.50.30.10 / Unbound
    |
    +--> AWS VPC Resolver 10.50.0.2 -> normal DNS
    |
    +--> resolver logs -> UF -> Splunk 10.50.20.10:9997
    |
    +--> RPZ local data when deliberately enabled
             |
             v
        Sinkhole 10.50.30.30:80
             |
             +--> Nginx access log -> UF -> Splunk
```

The final RPZ state keeps enforcement disabled until a later human-approved exercise response.
