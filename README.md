## 🎯 Project at a Glance

One SOC platform supports **four DNS security scenarios**. The infrastructure stays common where possible; scenario-specific resources are added only when a scenario needs them.

| Scenario | Security focus | MITRE ATT&CK | What the team practices |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🔎 [**01 — DNS Reconnaissance & Enumeration**](https://github.com/DNSentinel-Lab/Scenario-01-DNS-Recon) | Abnormal DNS record enumeration and follow-up activity | `T1590.002` | Public DNS visibility, detection, investigation and evidence correlation |
| 🧬 [**02 — DGA + High NXDOMAIN**](https://github.com/DNSentinel-Lab/Scenario-02-DGA) | Generated-domain behavior and abnormal NXDOMAIN activity | `T1568.002` | Defender-controlled resolution, baselining, detection/ML and containment path |
| 🔄 [**03 — Fast Flux DNS**](https://github.com/DNSentinel-Lab/Scenario-03-Fast-Flux) | Rapidly changing DNS answers and short-TTL behavior | `T1568.001` | DNS answer/TTL correlation and destination-change analysis |
| 🛰️ [**04 — DNS Tunneling**](https://github.com/DNSentinel-Lab/Scenario-04-DNS-Tunneling) | Controlled encoded DNS behavior | `T1071.004` / `T1572` where the implemented behavior fits | Suspicious query-pattern detection, investigation and response verification |

> MITRE mappings describe the behavior the team intends to simulate.

The detailed network, DNS authority, trust boundaries, CIDRs, security groups and traffic paths live in [`01-network-architecture/`](01-network-architecture/). The registrar/delegation chain is documented specifically in [`01-network-architecture/dns-authority-and-delegation.md`](01-network-architecture/dns-authority-and-delegation.md).

## 📡 Security Telemetry Pipeline

Splunk is the central evidence and analysis layer. The project combines public DNS, network, cloud, web and defender-controlled DNS telemetry instead of treating one source as the whole investigation.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    WEB[Web / Nginx] -->|UF · 9997| SPL[Splunk Enterprise]
    DNS[Unbound + Sinkhole] -->|UF · 9997| SPL
    R53[Route 53 Public DNS] -->|CloudWatch → Kinesis| SPL
    VPC[VPC Flow Logs] -->|S3 → SQS| SPL
    CT[CloudTrail] -->|S3 → SQS| SPL
    RQ[Resolver Query Logs] -->|S3 → SQS| SPL

    SPL --> IDX[dns_soc_aws · dns_soc_web · dns_soc_dns]
    SPL -->|Internal webhook| AIB[Shared AI Bridge]
    AIB --> OAI[OpenAI API]
    OAI --> AIB
    AIB -->|Internal HTTPS HEC| AIDX[dns_soc_ai]
```

The AWS collection layer uses the supported Splunk Add-on for AWS `8.2.1`. Live implementation recorded the following source identities:

| Telemetry | Destination index | Actual sourcetype |
|---|---|---|
| Route 53 public authoritative query logs | `dns_soc_aws` | `aws:kinesis` |
| VPC Flow Logs | `dns_soc_aws` | `aws:cloudwatchlogs:vpcflow` |
| CloudTrail | `dns_soc_aws` | `aws:cloudtrail` |
| Route 53 Resolver Query Logs | `dns_soc_aws` | `aws:s3` |
| Nginx access telemetry | `dns_soc_web` | `dns_soc:nginx:access` |
| Team-controlled Unbound resolver | `dns_soc_dns` | `unbound:dns` |
| Private sinkhole Nginx access | `dns_soc_web` | `nginx:access` |

> The defender repository also preserves Flow/Resolver evidence from the original in-account `ATTACK-LAB-VPC`. The **official Scenario 01 separate-account attacker does not export attacker-side telemetry into Splunk**; defender analysis relies on Route 53 authoritative logs and target-side Web/network evidence.

> Detailed onboarding, source validation and field-quality evidence are maintained in [`03-splunk-build/`](03-splunk-build/).

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73097560/115834477-dbab4500-a447-11eb-908a-139a6edaec5c.gif" width="100%" alt="section divider" />

## 🕶️ Official Scenario 01 adversary boundary

The official Scenario 01 exercise no longer uses the original in-account attack host as the defender-visible source. The Project Lead operates a Kali host from a **separate AWS account**, with an optional external Windows source, and reaches the lab only through public Internet services.

```text
External attacker account / Windows
        |
        | public DNS / HTTPS only
        v
Route 53 + public Web target
        |
        v
Defender telemetry → Splunk → SOC / IR
```

The SOC Analyst has no attacker-account inventory, no private network route and no live ground-truth feed. Historical `ATTACK-LAB-VPC` build evidence is retained as engineering history, but it is **not the official blind-exercise trust boundary**. See [`01-network-architecture/external-adversary-boundary.md`](01-network-architecture/external-adversary-boundary.md).

## 👥 Team & Rotating Roles

The four-role rotation model was designed so each member practices every major SOC role once across the four core scenarios. This model was **designed and proposed by [Lubaba](https://github.com/lubaba1513-pixel)**.

| Scenario | Project Lead / Adversary Operator | SOC Analyst / Hunter | Detection Engineer | IR / Defender |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 01 — DNS Recon | [Abdul-Rehman](https://github.com/abdul4rehman215) | [Musfira](https://github.com/MUSFIRA-ZAFAR) | [Sonia](https://github.com/sonia11mansha415) | [Lubaba](https://github.com/lubaba1513-pixel) |
| 02 — DGA + NXDOMAIN | Musfira | Sonia | Lubaba | Abdul-Rehman |
| 03 — Fast Flux | Sonia | Lubaba | Abdul-Rehman | Musfira |
| 04 — DNS Tunneling | Lubaba | Abdul-Rehman | Musfira | Sonia |

```text
External Adversary → Telemetry → Detection → AI Assistance → Blind SOC Investigation → IR / Defense → Ground-Truth Comparison → Documentation
```

See [`00-project-design/team-roles.md`](00-project-design/team-roles.md) for each role responsibilities.

## 📚 Documentation Model

This repository deliberately separates **design**, **implementation** and **scenario evidence**:

- **Design documents** explain how the lab is intended to work and why decisions were made.
- **Build documents** record what was actually configured and how it was validated.
- **Troubleshooting documents** keep useful root causes and final fixes.
- **Scenario repositories** contain scenario-specific preparation, execution, detection, analysis, response and evidence.

The common 20-part scenario workflow, networking view, MITRE discipline and dashboard engineering standard are defined in [`00-project-design/scenario-documentation-standard.md`](00-project-design/scenario-documentation-standard.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This lab is for **controlled security training** on infrastructure and domains owned by, or explicitly authorized for, the team.
