# Project Scope

## Objective

Build a realistic, network-centric DNS security lab where a four-person team can practice the full SOC lifecycle:

**External Adversary Activity → Telemetry → Splunk Detection → AI-Assisted Summary → Independent Human Investigation → Incident Response → Verification → Ground-Truth Comparison → Documentation**

The goal is not to create a single dashboard or one successful alert. Each exercise should leave enough evidence for the team to explain what happened at the DNS, network, cloud and system levels.

## Core platform

| Area | Decision |
|---|---|
| Cloud | Defender/SOC platform in the primary AWS account (`us-east-1`); official Scenario 01 Kali adversary in a separate AWS account; optional external Windows source |
| Domain registrar | Hostinger for `abdul4rehman215.tech` |
| Parent authoritative DNS | Route 53 public hosted zone for `abdul4rehman215.tech` |
| Public lab namespace | `soclab.abdul4rehman215.tech` |
| Child authoritative DNS | Separate Route 53 public hosted zone delegated from the parent zone |
| Public web targets | `soclab.abdul4rehman215.tech` -> `100.49.192.164`; `www.soclab.abdul4rehman215.tech` -> CNAME to the main hostname |
| Existing parent services | Preserved through the Route 53 parent zone, including website and mail-related DNS |
| SOC network | `SOC-LAB-VPC` |
| Official Scenario 01 attacker network | External Kali VPC in a separate AWS account; exact attacker-account identifiers intentionally excluded from defender documentation |
| Private attacker-to-defender connection | None — no peering, Transit Gateway or private route; official adversary uses public Internet services only |
| SIEM | Splunk Enterprise in Docker |
| Endpoint/server collection | Splunk Universal Forwarder where required |
| AWS telemetry | Route 53 public query logs, VPC Flow Logs, CloudTrail and AWS VPC Resolver Query Logs are active and validated in Splunk |
| Team-controlled DNS telemetry | Unbound query/reply/RPZ telemetry from `dns-soc-resolver01` is active in `dns_soc_dns` |
| AI | One shared Flask/OpenAI bridge is implemented on `dns-soc-splunk01`; scenario-specific profiles reuse it and remain analyst-validated |
| Static child-zone fixtures | Permanent `A`, `NS`, `SOA`, training `TXT` and `www` CNAME records |
| DNS defense | Scenario 02 defender resolver + reusable RPZ/sinkhole path is implemented and reused by later scenarios |

> [!NOTE]
> The original `ATTACK-LAB-VPC` (`10.60.0.0/16`) and `dns-attack01` were built during early infrastructure engineering and remain documented as historical evidence. The **official Scenario 01 information-separated exercise uses the separate-account Kali host instead**, so the defender cannot identify the attacker through same-account asset inventory.

## Current DNS telemetry boundary

Three DNS concepts must not be confused:

- **Route 53 public authoritative query logging** records queries reaching the public child hosted zone.
- **AWS VPC Resolver Query Logging** records queries handled by the AWS-provided resolver for associated VPC workloads.
- **Team-controlled Unbound logging** records the DNS path through `dns-soc-resolver01` and provides query/reply/RPZ evidence for the private victim path.

The Scenario 02 resolver forwards normal DNS upstream to `10.50.0.2`. Its own logs are copied through rsyslog to `/var/log/dns-soc/unbound.log` and forwarded to `index=dns_soc_dns`.

DNS Firewall is not part of the locked implementation. Containment uses the team-controlled Unbound RPZ path.

## Shared versus scenario-specific infrastructure

The common platform and Scenario 02 defender DNS infrastructure are now complete:

- **Scenario 01:** reuses the common AWS/Splunk/Web/DNS/AI platform.
- **Scenario 02:** uses the implemented private resolver, victim and sinkhole in `SOC-MONITORING-SUBNET`; Machine Learning Engineering, Detection Engineering, Dashboard Studio, scheduled alerting, AI integration, the information-separated DGA/SOC/IR exercise, human-approved RPZ containment, verification, and safe reset are complete in the dedicated Scenario 02 repository.
- **Scenario 03:** reused Scenario 02 and the temporary team-controlled Fast Flux destinations/short-TTL rotation. The official operator → SOC → IR exercise is complete in the Scenario 03 repository. IR independently classified the behavior as controlled/expected, did not activate RPZ because containment was not justified, verified resolver/RPZ safe state, and the temporary Fast Flux EC2 pool was retired after the exercise.
- **Scenario 04:** reuses the same defender DNS path and the implemented `dns-tunnel-auth01` authority/nested Route 53 delegation. The dedicated Scenario 04 repository now contains the complete lifecycle: baseline/hunting, Dashboard Studio, frozen Detection v1.0, scheduled alert, `dns_tunneling_v1`, official operator execution, independent SOC investigation, SOC→IR handoff, IR validation, temporary RPZ/sinkhole verification, safe reset and final ground-truth comparison.

The detailed resource state is maintained in [`scenario-infrastructure-roadmap.md`](scenario-infrastructure-roadmap.md). The common scenario workflow is maintained in [`scenario-documentation-standard.md`](scenario-documentation-standard.md).

## DNS authority boundary

Hostinger is the registrar, while Route 53 is authoritative:

```text
.tech registry
    |
    v
Route 53 parent zone: abdul4rehman215.tech
    |
    +-- existing parent website and mail records
    |
    +-- NS delegation for soclab
            |
            v
Route 53 child zone: soclab.abdul4rehman215.tech
            |
            +-- A -> 100.49.192.164
            +-- www CNAME -> soclab.abdul4rehman215.tech
            +-- TXT -> "DNS SOC Training Lab"
```

The public child zone stays stable. Scenario 02 DGA names are intentionally **not** pre-created; they should return real NXDOMAIN before any controlled RPZ response. The reusable sinkhole is private (`10.50.30.30`) and is not represented by a permanent public Route 53 record.

## Scope boundaries

The project focuses on DNS behavior and the network evidence around it. It may use endpoint, cloud or web telemetry when those sources help prove the DNS story, but the lab does not try to become a general-purpose attack range.

Adversary exercises are limited to infrastructure and domains the team owns or is explicitly authorized to test. High-volume public attacks, public DNS reflection/amplification, exploitation outside the scenario plan and uncontrolled exfiltration are outside scope.

## What the team should be able to demonstrate

By the end of the four scenarios, the project should show that the team can:

- design segmented AWS networking and reason about traffic paths;
- design and validate parent/child DNS authority and delegation;
- operate a private defender-side resolver and reusable containment path;
- onboard useful DNS, network, server and cloud telemetry into Splunk;
- baseline normal behavior before writing detections;
- build and tune SPL detections around defined threat behavior;
- compare rule-based analytics with ML only where the evidence supports it;
- investigate alerts using raw evidence rather than trusting a label;
- map observed behavior to MITRE ATT&CK without over-mapping;
- preserve evidence, contain confirmed incidents and verify the result;
- use AI as analyst assistance rather than an automated security decision-maker;
- document commands, decisions, failures, fixes and lessons learned.

## Definition of success

A scenario is complete only when the team can answer four questions with evidence:

1. **What behavior was generated?**
2. **What telemetry captured it?**
3. **Why did the detection or investigation classify it the way it did?**
4. **What changed after the response, and how was that verified?**
