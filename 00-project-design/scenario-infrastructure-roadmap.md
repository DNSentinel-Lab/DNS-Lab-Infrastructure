# Scenario Infrastructure Roadmap

**Status:** Scenario 02 defender DNS infrastructure complete; Scenario 03–04 additions remain just-in-time.

The shared AWS/Splunk/Web/DNS/AI platform is not rebuilt for each scenario. New infrastructure is added only when the scenario needs a real new network/service behavior.

## Shared foundation already complete

- `SOC-LAB-VPC` — `10.50.0.0/16`
- `ATTACK-LAB-VPC` — `10.60.0.0/16` (**historical in-account engineering environment; not the official Scenario 01 information-separated attacker source**)
- Route 53 parent + delegated `soclab` child zone
- `dns-soc-web01` + Nginx/HTTPS + Web UF
- `dns-soc-splunk01` + Splunk Enterprise + project indexes
- Route 53 public query logs
- VPC Flow Logs
- CloudTrail
- AWS VPC Resolver Query Logs
- shared `dns-soc-ai-bridge`
- `dns-attack01` (**historical in-account engineering host**)
- official Scenario 01 Kali adversary in a **separate AWS account**
- optional external Windows adversary source

## Scenario 01 — DNS Reconnaissance

Defender infrastructure requires no additional resource. Scenario 01 uses the existing public DNS, public Web target, AWS telemetry, Splunk and shared AI bridge.

The official adversary boundary is external to the defender account:

```text
Separate AWS account / Kali
        + optional external Windows
                 |
                 | public Internet only
                 v
         Route 53 / public Web
                 |
                 v
            defender telemetry
```

The original in-account `ATTACK-LAB-VPC` is retained only as historical engineering evidence and is not used as the official information-separated attacker source.

## Scenario 02 — DGA + High NXDOMAIN

**Infrastructure: COMPLETE**

### Implemented private hosts

| Host | Address | Subnet | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dns-soc-resolver01` | `10.50.30.10` | `SOC-MONITORING-SUBNET` | Unbound defender resolver, RPZ and resolver telemetry |
| `dns-soc-victim01` | `10.50.30.20` | `SOC-MONITORING-SUBNET` | Controlled client for later DGA/high-NXDOMAIN generation |
| `dns-soc-sinkhole01` | `10.50.30.30` | `SOC-MONITORING-SUBNET` | Reusable private Nginx containment/evidence endpoint |

The roles remain separate. Splunk is not used as the DNS resolver, and the victim is not co-hosted with the resolver.

### Private egress

Created `SOC-MONITORING-NAT` in the public `SOC-TARGET-SUBNET` (`us-east-1c`). `SOC-PRIVATE-RT` now provides:

```text
10.50.0.0/16 -> local
0.0.0.0/0    -> SOC-MONITORING-NAT
```

This lets the private Scenario 02 hosts install packages and reach required external management endpoints without public IPv4 addresses.

Normal DNS forwarding is separate and uses AWS VPC Resolver `10.50.0.2`.

### Security groups

```text
SG-DNS
  UDP/TCP 53 <- SG-VICTIM

SG-VICTIM
  no inbound application service

SG-SINKHOLE
  TCP 80 <- SG-VICTIM

SG-SPLUNK
  TCP 9997 <- SG-DNS
  TCP 9997 <- SG-VICTIM   (reserved; victim UF not installed yet)
  TCP 9997 <- SG-SINKHOLE
```

DNS `53` is not exposed publicly.

### Resolver path

```text
Victim 10.50.30.20
       |
       v
Unbound 10.50.30.10
       |
       v
AWS VPC Resolver 10.50.0.2
       |
       v
Route 53 / Internet DNS
```

Unbound logs queries/replies, forwards to `10.50.0.2`, and now includes RPZ support through the `respip iterator` module chain.

### Resolver telemetry

```text
Unbound -> syslog -> rsyslog filtered file
        -> /var/log/dns-soc/unbound.log
        -> Splunk UF -> TCP 9997
        -> index=dns_soc_dns / sourcetype=unbound:dns
```

Validated fields include `event_type`, `client_ip`, `qname`, `qtype`, `rcode`, `response_time`, `cache_flag` and `response_size` where the event provides them.

### Sinkhole path

```text
Unbound RPZ
   -> controlled local-data answer 10.50.30.30
   -> dns-soc-sinkhole01 / Nginx
   -> /var/log/nginx/access.log
   -> Splunk UF
   -> index=dns_soc_web / sourcetype=nginx:access
```

The RPZ path was tested first in disabled/log-only behavior, then with one controlled redirect, then reset to disabled enforcement. The reusable control remains available for future human-approved response testing.

### Completed infrastructure documents

- [`../02-aws-build/08-scenario-02-defender-dns.md`](../02-aws-build/08-scenario-02-defender-dns.md)
- [`../03-splunk-build/07-scenario-02-dns-onboarding.md`](../03-splunk-build/07-scenario-02-dns-onboarding.md)
- [`../01-network-architecture/diagrams/scenario-02-defender-dns.mmd`](../01-network-architecture/diagrams/scenario-02-defender-dns.mmd)

### Work outside the infrastructure layer

The dedicated Scenario 02 repository now records **Machine Learning Engineering and Detection Engineering readiness as complete**, including Dashboard Studio, the frozen rule, scheduled alerting, Rule ↔ ML comparison and Scenario 02 AI evidence integration. The following official scenario stages remain outside this infrastructure repository:

- fresh information-separated controlled DGA/high-NXDOMAIN adversary execution;
- private ground-truth record and later reveal;
- independent SOC investigation and disposition;
- IR validation and human-approved response decision;
- RPZ/sinkhole containment only if warranted;
- before/after verification, safe reset and final evidence comparison.

## Scenario 03 — Fast Flux

Reuse the completed Scenario 02 resolver/victim/sinkhole platform.

Only add what Fast Flux genuinely requires:

- team-controlled temporary destination endpoints if not already available;
- temporary short-TTL `flux.soclab...` A records;
- controlled answer rotation;
- resolver + VPC Flow correlation;
- cleanup/reset after the exercise.

No new VPC, Splunk server, AI bridge or second sinkhole is expected.

## Scenario 04 — DNS Tunneling

Reuse the Scenario 02 defender DNS platform.

Potential additional infrastructure is conditional:

- if the final controlled tunneling simulation can be represented through the existing resolver/public DNS path, reuse it;
- if the exercise genuinely requires an authoritative server that receives encoded labels, deploy one controlled endpoint/delegation at Scenario 04 preparation time;
- reuse the existing RPZ/sinkhole path for human-approved containment verification.

Do not create a permanent authoritative tunnel service before the scenario needs it.

## Infrastructure discipline

For every new scenario resource:

1. record the reason it is needed;
2. keep addressing and SG rules inside the locked network plan;
3. validate service and telemetry before detection engineering;
4. preserve repository-safe configuration/evidence;
5. reset temporary DNS/containment changes after the exercise;
6. never publish credentials, API keys, private keys or sensitive account details.
